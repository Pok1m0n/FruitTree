# FruitTree
A JTree that supports Drag and Drop, Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo/Redo.

Born out of the frustration of trying to find an example anywhere that implements all the fruit. This is a more-or-less bare-bones model to build on.

Also includes:
- a friendlier cell editor,
- a toolbar, and
- additional edit actions;
  - Clone, and
  -  Delete.
